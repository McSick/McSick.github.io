# Hello

My name is Michael Sickles. Former Developer, now Presales Solutions Architect.  I constantly find myself doing random one off projects and felt like I should share them to the world.  Expect that most of these projects are graveyarded. I don't expect to keep these up to date. 

I also plan on occaisionally posting random thoughts about other topics as well. Most of what I will write about will be related to programming so at least it should hopefully be relevant to your interest if you managed to land yourself here.
