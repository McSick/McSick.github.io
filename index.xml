Former Developer, now Presales Solutions Architect. I constantly find myself doing random one off projects and felt like I should share them to the world. Expect that most of these projects are graveyarded. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to keep these up to date.
I also plan on occaisionally posting random thoughts about other topics as well. Most of what I will write about will be related to programming so at least it should hopefully be relevant to your interest if you managed to land yourself here.</description><content>&lt;h1 id="hello">Hello&lt;/h1>
